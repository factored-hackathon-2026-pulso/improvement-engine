# Pulso improvement engine

Autonomous detection and improvement service integrating external Agent Core primitives.

## Current slice

Layer 0 provides a minimal Rust workspace, a public tracer for the core crate, and its first read-only source-boundary slice. The source validator loads canonical JSON contracts in deterministic filename order and compares adapter-supplied bytes with a sealed synthetic snapshot; it emits deterministic findings for contract, header, file-digest and policy drift without opening bank data itself. It establishes a reproducible local verification command:

```powershell
cargo test --workspace
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*_contract.py" -v
python contracts/validate_fixtures.py
```

The GitHub Actions workflow additionally checks formatting, Clippy, Rust unit/integration harnesses, contract unit tests and the complete contract-fixture validator on Windows and Linux. This does not implement detection, artifacts, an Agent Core runtime, a model gateway, authenticated real-data ingestion, or any external call. Infrastructure lives in sibling `infra`.
